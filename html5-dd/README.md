backbone-html5-app
==================

An app using backbone for MVC in the frontend. 
Images can be dropped from OS (any file / folder) into the browser (Drop placeholder)

Requires your browser to support:
- File API
- HTML5 DnD
- LocalStorage (Be sure to toggle "Clear LocalStorage", once you are done playing. Coz lots of data is stored in that !!)

Still optimizing it for File Blob and a better UI
