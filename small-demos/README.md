Small demos that are too small to put as a separate Repo, but too cool to be missed

There is no separate index page for these demos  
One would land to a particular demo page either from my [Blog](http://geekyogi.tumblr.com) or from [Experiments Landing page](http://omshiv.github.io/experiments)

I am still struggling to recognize myself in the Open Source Community  
Thank you for your patience towards my noobness, therefore.
